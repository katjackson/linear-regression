# Linear Regression

This repository contains an exercise in using scikit-learn to calculate and plot linear regression.

While the linear_regression.py file contains all of the relevant code, the jupyter notebook [simple-linear-regression.ipynb](https://github.com/katjackson/linear-regression/blob/master/simple-linear-regression.ipynb) allows you to view a sample of the data, the output of certain calculations, and the helpful plots.

Observations include predictions based on linear regression of ground cricket chirps and ground temperature, coefficient of determination or R<sup>2</sup> for a linear regression of mammal brain size to body size, and a multiple linear regression of a data set of university salary data.
